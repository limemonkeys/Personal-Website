                    My name is Mac Burton. 
                    <br><br>
                    I am a New Grad who recieved a Bachelors of Computer Science 
                    and Certificate of User Experience Design and Evaluation from 
                    Dalhousie University.
                    <br><br>
                    I love to keep myself busy with my free time with
                    personal projects relating to my studies. More specifically, I
                    have a passion for game development and find myself participating 
                    in game jams when I can.
                    <br><br>
                    I also enjoy trading card games and cooking with my free time.
                    <br><br>
                    I recently retired as President and Founder of the Dalhousie
                    Trading Card Game Society. Has been going strong for four years.
                    My Trading Card Game of choice is Magic the Gathering and I enjoy
                    casual EDH and competitive modern.
                    <br><br>
                    I volunteered frequently with the Loaded Ladle for the past year.
                    The Loaded Ladle is a non-profit open food cooperative, providing free
                    meal services to the community from Tuesday to Friday. The Loaded
                    Ladle serves upwards of 300 people each day. I have also run a team
                    for the Iron Ladle: A cooking competition in which I assembled a team
                    and planned a recipe for one of the services.
                    <br><br>
                    I am a part time musician with the 36 Canadian Brigade Group Band 
                    with the Department of National Defense as a Army Reservist at the 
                    rank of Corporal. I have attended the Canadian Forces School of Music
                    at Canadian Forces Base Borden in Ontario.
